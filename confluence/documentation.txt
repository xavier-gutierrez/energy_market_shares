Data

My understanding of the data that we want – with as long of a time series as possible – are:

(1) Total annual electricity generation by fuel

    Existing capacity by fuel type and producer type (avoid industrial and commercial power generation)
    Capital, operations, maintenance, and fuel costs for electricity generation plants, by fuel (and technology, where possible)
    Capacity additions, retirements and changes by energy source is available (1994-2014)(Source: http://www.eia.gov/electricity/annual/)


I have the first from 1949 – 2014 for 12 fuel categories, so we’re good there (attached).

For the second, I currently have:
* Operations, maintenance, and fuel costs from 2003-2012 (attached).
* I also have “overnight capital costs”, “fixed O&M costs", and "variable O&M costs” for 2010 only (with updated overnight capital costs in 2011), by detailed production technology (e.g., advanced pn w/ ccs, dual unit igcc, advanced ngcc w/ ccs).

Anupriya looked for any other time series data on capital, O&M, and fuel costs, by electricity generation type, but also couldn't find any.

The EIA data can be found here: http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/index.cfm#electricity and the chapter with the energy price data is here: http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec9.pdf
